    """A very general description of the class.

    The __init__ method may be documented in either the class level
    docstring, or as a docstring on the __init__ method itself.

    Either form is acceptable, but the two should not be mixed. Choose one
    convention to document the __init__ method and be consistent with it.

    Note:
        A note to the user of this class.
